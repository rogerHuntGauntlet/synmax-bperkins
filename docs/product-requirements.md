# Ship Micro-Motion Analysis System
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 1. Product Overview
The Ship Micro-Motion Analysis System is a web application that processes Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to detect and analyze micro-motions of ships. The application implements the algorithm from the research paper "Micro-Motion Estimation of Maritime Targets Using Pixel Tracking in Cosmo-Skymed Synthetic Aperture Radar Data—An Operative Assessment".

### 2. User Requirements

#### 2.1 Primary User Needs
- Upload large SAR image files (CPHD, TIFF, HDF5 formats)
- Process SAR data to detect ships and their micro-motions
- View analysis results including displacement fields and frequency mode visualizations
- Use sample data for demonstration purposes

#### 2.2 User Flow
1. User navigates to web application
2. User chooses to upload their SAR file or select from sample data
3. System processes the file and displays loading indicator
4. Results are displayed visually with displacement fields and frequency analyses
5. User can download or share analysis results

### 3. Functional Requirements

#### 3.1 Core Features
- **File Upload**: Support for large files (up to 5GB)
- **Sample Data Access**: Pre-configured sample datasets from Umbra
- **SAR Processing**: Implementation of the pixel tracking algorithm
- **Ship Detection**: Automated identification of ships in SAR imagery
- **Micro-motion Analysis**: Extraction of displacement fields and vibration modes
- **Visualization**: Interactive display of results with supporting metrics

#### 3.2 Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: Process 3GB files within 10 minutes
- **Scalability**: Handle up to 100 concurrent users
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for the web interface
- **Security**: Secure file handling and user session management

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Internationalization**: English interface with support for metric units
- **Compliance**: Academic citation of original algorithm source

### 5. Future Enhancements
- Batch processing of multiple files
- Comparative analysis between different SAR images
- API access for integration with other systems
- Advanced filtering and detection parameters

### 6. Success Metrics
- 90% success rate in ship detection
- Processing time under 10 minutes for 3GB files
- User satisfaction rating of 4.0/5.0 or higher
- Zero data security incidents
